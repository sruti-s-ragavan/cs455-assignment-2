This is run using node.js (a run time environment for JS)
{Node is to JS, just like the python run time is to python, or jre is to java}

To understand the pipelines, 
look for package.json, and look inside the scripts section. 
To run any script, use npm run <scriptname>. 

npm is node package manager, a tool to install and manage node packages (but I'd rather call it project manager, as it does way more than package manager these days).
